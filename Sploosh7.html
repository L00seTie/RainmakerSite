          <h3>Why the Sploosh 7?</h3>
          <p>
            You can use any weapon you want in Rainmaker, but Sploosh 7 is a
            particularly effective pick for the following reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">It's lightweight</span>, which gives it a 5%
              increase in swim speed (an essential ability for rotating between
              positions as fast as possible)
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">It has a high Damage Per Second (DPS)</span>,
              which is useful both for popping the rainmaker shield and for
              ambushing opponents who push into your base
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">It has a lethal bomb (Splat Bomb)</span>,
              which serves to immediately control the area in front of the
              rainmaker on defense, or flush the enemy team out of position on
              offense.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">It has Ultra Stamp</span> which, similar to
              Splat Bomb, serves to instantly take space or move the enemy out
              of position. Stamp is also useful to shield the rainmaker carrier
              from incoming bombs and shots.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">It has a high paint output</span>, which helps
              you take space quickly and gives you paint to shark in on defense
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          <img
            class="floatsm"

            alt="The Sploosh-O-Matic 7"
          />
          <h3>The Main Weapon</h3>
          <p>
            The Sploosh-O-Matic itself is very well-suited for Rainmaker.
            <span class="topic">Use its high DPS</span> to shred the Rainmaker
            shield, shark for insta-kills on the Rainmaker carrier, and tear
            through any defenses the enemy team puts up. <br /><br />
            Its range is quite short, so
            <span class="topic">keep yourself in safe, hidden positions</span>
            as often as possible and don't make yourself known to the enemy team
            until it's absolutely necessary. <br /><br />
            <span class="topic">Use the speed and paint output</span> to your
            advantage by covering new area as quickly as possible and covering
            your base with a large, even coat of paint to shark in when
            defending.
          </p>

          <img class="floatsm" src="images/Bomb.png" alt="A splat bomb" />
          <h3>Splat Bombs</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="topic">Splat bombs are lethal bombs</span>, which means
            they have the potential to kill the enemy instantly when they
            explode (without needing to combo with other damage). Lethal bombs
            serve as guaranteed area control because after you throw one, you
            know the space you threw it in will be clear once it explodes
            (because the enemy will have either moved or died at that point).
            <br /><br />
            This is important for all modes, but
            <span class="topic"
              >in Rainmaker they're especially necessary for defense</span
            >. The Rainmaker carrier's goal is to get to the pedestal, so the
            defending team will want to do whatever they can to prevent them
            from getting near it. <br /><br />
            <img
              class="float"
              src="images/BombThrow.jpg"
              alt="A player throwing a bomb"
            />
            However, because pushes in rainmaker happen very fast,<span
              class="topic"
            >
              many of the usual forms of defense</span
            >
            (ex. charging a charger or splatling, setting up ink mines, or even
            just taking the time to properly aim at your opponent)
            <span class="topic"
              >are not fast enough to prevent the Rainmaker from moving
              forward</span
            >. Lethal bombs, on the other hand, are instant, easy to use, and
            guarantee control of an area. <br /><br />
            <span class="topic"
              >Use Splat Bombs to your advantage by throwing them between the
              Rainmaker and the pedestal</span
            >
            any time you're defending. The longer you keep the Rainmaker at bay,
            the longer you'll have to charge your specials, get a pick, and
            start a counterpush. <br /><br />
            <span class="topic"
              >You can also use Splat Bombs during a push</span
            >
            by throwing them at the positions you would normally be in to
            defend. This ensures that all the best defensive positions are
            difficult to stand in, making it all the more awkward for the enemy
            team to do their job.

          <h3>Ultra Stamp</h3>
          <img
            class="float"
            src="images/Stamping.jpg"
            alt="Ultra Stamp in hammering mode"
          />
          <p>
            <span class="topic"
              >Ultra Stamp serves a very similar function to Splat Bombs</span
            >
            in that it's lethal and guarantees area control wherever it's
            stamped or thrown. In addition to that, it can also serve as a
            shield to the rainmaker, blocking incoming shots and bombs.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="topic"
              >Use the Ultra Stamp to your advantage during a push</span
            >
            by positioning yourself in between the Rainmaker and any defending
            players and hammering forward, trying to block their attacks.
            <br /><br />
            <img
              class="float"
              src="images/Throwing.jpg"
              alt="Ultra Stamp in thrown mode"
            />
            <span class="topic">You can also use it to paint a trail</span> up
            to the pedestal, as the stamp trail leaves enough ink to swim in. If
            the defense is above you to the point where they're out of reach of
            your stamp, you can also
            <span class="topic">throw your hammer</span> at them like you would
            a bomb to guarantee they won't be there for a moment. <br /><br />
            <span class="topic">Try to save your Ultra Stamp for offense</span>
            if you possibly can, but if you must use it on defense, you can
            position yourself between the enemy team and your pedestal and block
            their path by hammering forward. You can also use your hammer to
            <span class="topic">quickly pop the Rainmaker shield</span> if
            needed.

          <h3>Gear</h3>
          <img
            class="float"
            src="images/Gear.jpg"
            alt="My gear, with last-ditch effort, object-shredder, 
            1 main and 5 subs of swim-speed up, 2 subs of special power up, 
            1 sub of quick superjump, and 1 sub of special saver."
          />
          <p>
            Gear is largely up to you, but I recommend running
            <span class="topic"
              >last ditch effort (LDE), object shredder (OBS), and as much swim
              speed as possible</span
            >. Utility subs (ink resistance, bomb defense DX, and quick
            superjump) are also nice to have, but aren't as essential as the
            first three. <br /><br />
            I personally use two subs of sub power up to be able to reach more
            positions with my splat bombs, and special saver to have my special
            ready sooner on defense. Sub abilities like this aren't absolutely
            essential, though, and I recommend experimenting and finding gear
            that works for you.
