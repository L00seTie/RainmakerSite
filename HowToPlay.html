          <h3>Opening</h3>
          <img
            class="float"
            src="images/RedManta.png"
            alt="An overhead map of Manta Maria with a red path leading from 
            spawn to home bunker."
          />
          <p>
            In the opening, you’ll want to get to mid and pop the rainmaker
            shield as fast as possible to give your team special advantage.
            Don’t pick up the rainmaker at this point, though, because you’ll be
            putting yourself and your team at a disadvantage while the enemy
            team still has four players in the game. Instead, focus on safely
            getting a pick by throwing bombs into mid and any positions you see
            taken. <br /><br />
            Whichever team has a member go down first will become the defending
            team, and whichever team has player advantage first will become the
            first team to push. Your opening is your chance to make your team
            the first team to push (which is extra important in Rainmaker
            because the first push can end the game).
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Pushing</h3>
          <img class="float" src="images/YellowManta.png" alt="An overhead map of 
          Manta Maria with an orange path leading from home bunker to enemy bunker 
          and a yellow path leading from enemy bunker to enemy pedestal.">
          <p>
            When you get your first kill on the enemy team (without any kills on
            your own team), that puts your team in a position to make a push.
            Use this numbers advantage to get a second kill, as you need a
            two-player advantage in order to compensate for the disadvantage
            carrying the Rainmaker gives your team. <br /><br />
            Once you have a two-player advantage, that’s the time to push forward:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span class="topic">Push the objective along the safest route</span> (the one where it's 
                most difficult to get surrounded, and gives 
                you the best view of potential approach options)
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="topic">Move the enemy out of their defensive positions</span> (you can do this by 
                throwing bombs, using your special, or firing the rainmaker)
              </li>
              <li><span class="topic">Dunk the rainmaker,</span> or go retreat once you lose your player advantage.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Defending</h3>
          <img class="float" src="images/GreenManta.png" alt="An overhead map of Manta Maria with a green 
          path leading from home bunker to the platform in front of home mast and a blue path 
          leading from that platform to the floor next to home pedestal.">
          <p>
            Any time the enemy team has a player advantage, they have an opportunity to push, 
            making your team the defending team. As soon as you see that you have less people 
            than the enemy, it's time to start your defense:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">Retreat to a defensive position</span> (like the rainmaker path, the best defensive 
              positions are those that make it difficult to be surrounded and easy to see your 
              enemy's approach options)
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">Stall the Rainmaker by throwing bombs at it</span> (stalling is always advantageous for 
              the defending team in Rainmaker due to the special advantage you get from it and 
              the timer on the Rainmaker counting down when it's held)
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">Hide in your ink</span> as much as possible and try to kill anyone that comes your way
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="topic">The Rainmaker will eventually die or retreat.</span> This is your chance to counterpush and put your team on offense again.
            </li>
          </ol>
